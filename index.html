                <h2>Why Foster a Pet?</h2>
                <p>Fostering a rescue animal is one of the most rewarding experiences. When you foster, you provide a safe and loving home while we work to find them their forever family. Your support directly saves lives and creates space for us to rescue more animals in need.</p>
                <p>Fosters receive support from our team, including veterinary care and supplies. Join our community of pet lovers making a difference today!</p>
